# Plant-Disease-Detection-By-Deeplearning

This project aims to detect plant diseases using deep learning techniques. It involves training a model, generating the model.h5 file, and deploying the model locally using Flask. The dataset used for training is sourced from Kaggle and the project is done by Jeevan R.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alwaysjeevanr/Plant-Disease-Detection-By-Deeplearning.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.
    Datasets : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neeleshj/plant-village/
    Already Exists in PlantVillage Floder

4. Train the model:

    ```bash
    # Edit Paths and run train.ipnb jupyter notebook.
    ```

    This will generate the model file.
    Already `model.h5` exists

5. Start the Flask application:

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the Plant Disease Detection application.

7. Make your contribution:

    - Fork the repository on GitHub.
    - Create a new branch for your contribution.
    - Make your changes and commit them.
    - Push the changes to your forked repository.
    - Open a pull request on the original repository to propose your changes.

8. Wait for the project to review and merge your pull request.

9. Celebrate your contribution to the Plant Disease Detection project!
